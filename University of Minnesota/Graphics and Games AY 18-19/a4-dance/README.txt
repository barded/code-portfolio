/**
   CSci-4611 Assignment 4:  Dance Ants
   Deandra Bardell
**/

Summary: I did everything in the C, B, and A range.

I don't feel like there's a lot to talk about since there wasn't a lot to do.

Figuring out what all the code did and the methods I actually needed to use was the hardest.

I read the directions multiple times, and then the methods I needed to use were more obvious, especially for ctm. Initially for child_root_transform I had the order wrong, so my figures looked like scarecrows. After messing with ctm, I realized it was the child_root_transform.

I tried my best to make smooth transitions by trimming and adjusting overlay. I think I did pretty well given the tuning options we have. It's harder when the figure has to do a 180 because that turn is pretty much all lerp. However, moving the figure away from us is important so the figure can do other dance moves and remain seen.

I decided to stick with the ants theme and make ants. I used scale, rotate, and translation to make ants out of spheres, lines, and antennas as cones. My antennas are simple because I didn't want them to be distracting. This was trial and error. The scale is quite small, so I definitely had to mess with the numbers a bit. I think studying transformations for the midterm and then doing this assignment helped. I feel like I had a handle on transformations before jumping in to this, which helped me. I knew the overall steps I needed to do, and just had to figure out how to implement them.
